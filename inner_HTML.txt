You might not always feel sick from viruses. However, viruses can make you seriously ill and cause disease.

The disease caused by this virus has different names. The disease is called COVID-19 – Coronavirus Disease 2019 for the year in which it first appeared globally. COVID-19 is also known as “novel coronavirus,” meaning a new type of coronavirus not previously discovered or identified.The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are:Fever,Cough,Shortness of Breath.The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily in some affected geographic areas.
